# ROM Art Downloader

This can be used to download all the art for your ROM's from http://retrogaming.cloud/.  It was written to populate the local images folder of [Ice](http://scottrice.github.io/Ice/)

# Usage

    rom-art-downloader <path to roms> <path for images>

# Notes

Your ROM names _must_ match those on retrogaming, or else their "search" API will not work.  Additionally, if you run this on a lot of games at once, you may hit their rate limiting of about 2 a second.
